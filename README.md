# Code for the paper - A Mechanism for Producing Aligned Latent Spaces with Autoencoders 

Description of directories: 

(1) verification_of_theory : contains code to verify our theoretical results

(2) 

(3) cmap_alignment : contains code to construct autoencoders that align drug signatures across MCF7 and A549 cell types.  This code relies on the code from https://github.com/uhlerlab/covid19_repurposing/tree/main/Code_autoencoding.
